@article{ERIHCI:911197,
	Abstract = {Two channels have been distinguished in human interaction: one transmits explicit messages, which may be about anything or nothing; the other transmits implicit messages about the speakers themselves. Both linguistics and technology have invested enormous efforts in understanding the first, explicit channel, but the second is not as well understood. Understanding the other party's emotions is one of the key tasks associated with the second, implicit channel. To tackle that task, signal processing and analysis techniques have to be developed, while, at the same time, consolidating psychological and linguistic analyses of emotion. This article examines basic issues in those areas. It is motivated by the PKYSTA project, in which we aim to develop a hybrid system capable of using information from faces and voices to recognize people's emotions},

	Abstract = {In the visual cortex of the brain, long-ranging tangentially oriented axon collaterals interconnect regularly spaced clusters of cells. These connections develop after birth and attain their specificity by pruning. To test whether there is selective stabilization of connections between those cells that exhibit correlated activity, kittens were raised with artificially induced strabismus (eye deviation) to eliminate the correlation between signals from the two eyes. In area 17, cell clusters were driven almost exclusively from either the right or the left eye and tangential intracortical fibers preferentially connected cell groups activated by the same eye. Thus, circuit selection depends on visual experience, and the selection criterion is the correlation of activity.},
